# Projects
This respiratory git contains diffrent projects I worked on; either through studies, work or independently.

## Reddit number of comments and bitcoin price [(see the project)](https://github.com/polarteddybear/Projects/blob/main/Reddit%20number%20of%20comments%20and%20bitcoin%20price.ipynb)
In This work I will try to see if there is a relationship between bitcoin price and the number of comments on the daily threads of the popular trading subreddit 'Bitcoin Markets'. The popular subreddit is known to be a hub of bitcoin traders and enthusiasts.
